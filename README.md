# A Thin-Lens Paraxial Raytrace App

A simple demonstration project that traces [paraxial rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraxial_approximation) through a system of [thin optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_lens).

Optical power is the reciprocal of focal length. The optical elements are displayed as a convex lens (positive power), concave lens (negative power), or an open aperture (zero power). Angles are given in radians and should be small for the approximation.
